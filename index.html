          <h1>Hey! This is Data. ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­</h1>
          <p>My full name is <strong>Supanat Suriyodorn</strong>, or you might have also heard of me as <strong>ZikXewen</strong>.</p>
          <p>
            Computers and electronics were a great part of my childhood core memory since my dear father introduced me to this field.
            He gave me chances to try my hands on some basic coding, scripting, and even some circuitry since I was a little kid.
            Since then, I have been seeking for my own path, notably putting my focus into competitive programming in my highschool years.
            But during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, I came back to try out other aspects in the world of computers.
            So far I am loving software engineering, although many other stuff also piqued my interest: home networking and DevSecOps to list a couple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I am studying abroad ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. Pursuing bachelor degrees in Computer Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
            I am very grateful for this opportunity, and I hope to make the best use of it!
